I am Mangaladitya Chatterjee, <br /> a dedicated and ambitious student with a strong academic background, having scored 92.28% in Class 10 and 87.28% in Class 12 from Bhadiswasr Shayamapada Roy Vidyabhaban. My passion for technology drove me to self-learn web development, mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React, WordPress, WooCommerce, and Git through YouTube tutorials.

By effectively leveraging online resources, I developed the skills to create visually appealing, dynamic, and responsive websites, as well as manage content and e-commerce platforms proficiently. Balancing my academic responsibilities with intensive self-study, I have honed my time management, self-discipline, and proactive learning abilities.

My journey exemplifies resilience and a relentless pursuit of knowledge. With a blend of academic excellence and technical skills, I am well-prepared to make significant contributions to the field of web development, bringing creativity and innovation to every project I undertake. </h4>
